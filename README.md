# Machine Learning From Scratch with C++

Implementations of Classic Machine Learning Algorithm with C++
(some visualization works are implemented with python)

### ToDo List
- [X] k-means
- [X] k-NN (k nearest neighbors)
- [X] regression trees
- [ ] simple linear regresion
- [ ] multiple variable linear regression with SGD
- [ ] logistic regression with SGD
- [ ] perceptron
- [ ] MLP with backpropagation
- [ ] optimizer (SGD, Adam)
