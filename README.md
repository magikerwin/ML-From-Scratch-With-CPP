# Machine Learning From Scratch with C++

Implementations of Classic Machine Learning Algorithm with C++
(some visualization works are implemented with python)

### ToDo List
- [X] k-means
- [X] k-NN (k nearest neighbors)
- [X] regression trees
- [X] simple linear regresion
- [X] multiple variable linear regression with SGD
- [X] logistic regression with SGD
- [X] perceptron
- [X] MLP with backpropagation
- [X] optimizer (SGD, Adam)
- [ ] random forest
- [ ] convolutional neural network
